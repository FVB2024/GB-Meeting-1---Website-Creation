    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      He was the CEO and creator of Jurassic Park. He founded the company InGen
      and the Hammond Foundation. He had at least one daughter, two
      grandchildren (Tim and Lex Murphy), a sister (as Hammond's nephew has the
      surname of Ludlow, not Hammond) and a nephew, Peter Ludlow.
    </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      He had little interest in the technicalities of genetic engineering, but
      great interest in making a profit and progress. His darker side is shown
      more often, as he is frequently upset with his employees and seems to care
      more about the safety of his expensive animals. Hammond has drastic mood
      swings and quickly turns from angered to sympathetic.
