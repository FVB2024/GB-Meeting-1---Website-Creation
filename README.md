Make everyone get Visual Studio Code for Windows/Mac.
Make them download the following extesnions: HTML, CSS, HTML CSS Support, and Live Server (so they can launch their webistes).
Make them create a new folder, create a new HTML file, CSS file, and find an image that they want to showcase on their website and add it to the folder.
Now that everything is on visual studio, check to see what time it is, if there's a lot of time, explain why the code works, if there is 10 minutes or less left before lunch ends, just make them copy the code from the github and say that next metting we will exaplin how it all works.
